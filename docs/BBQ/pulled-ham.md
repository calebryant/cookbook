## Ingredients
- *1* bone in ham
- *1 stick* butter
- *1 jar* peach preserves
- BBQ rub
- *1 cup* water

## Cookware
- aluminum roasting pan
- foil

## Steps
1. Preheat smoker to 225. Place bone in ham on smoker, as is, until internal
temp reads 170.

2. As you're nearing 170 internal, you'll want to start preparing the glaze.

3. In a medium saucepan, place butter, peach preserves, and about 2 tbsp of BBQ
rub. Heat on medium heat until melted and combined.

4. Once the ham is 170, remove from smoker, and place in aluminum roasting pan
cut side down. Pour water into bottom of the pan. Then pour the glaze over the
top of the ham. Cover with foil and back onto the smoker.

5. Increase smoker temp to 275, and roast until internal temp of 200. Remove,
rest, and pull.

6. I like to drizzle a few spoonfuls of the glaze over the shredded ham, and a
little more sprinkles of the rub.
